************ Smart knee rehabilitation device **************

- The goal of this project is to create a smart knee rehabilitation device that restrict unexpected knee mouvement that can cause a knee problems and injuries .
- the solution to create a device that sense the rotation angle of the knee , then define the threeshold angle of knee that may cause a knee problem to create a control system algorithm that detect this unexpected wrong mouvement and try instantanously to return back the knee to it's initial position (angle = 0->5Â°) using an industrial servo motor with high torque value controlled by current flow comming from the microcontroller to restrict those knee mouvements.


- Technologies & Tools : mixed electronic signals , firmware developement , control system PID , healthcare concept , fritzing .
